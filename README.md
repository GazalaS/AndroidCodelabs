### DisplayImages Android Application : List of kittens
The goal for this code lab is to create an application that will show a number of photos (of kittens) in a list or a grid. 
Start by implementing a RecyclerView, an adapter and itâ€™s item view. Next, put a single image into the application drawables that you will reuse for 10 items in the RecyclerView. Experiment with modifying the properties of the RecyclerView and changing its layout manager.
Next, as an advanced version of this code lab, put several images (of kittens) on the media store of the emulator or device and load all of those into the list using the MediaStore API and Picasso (See previous Image picker codelab).
